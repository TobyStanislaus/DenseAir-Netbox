 **Netbox API calls**

 This project has its use as it fetches the data of the architecture of the DenseAir network from Netbox, 
 which in itself fetches its data from our servers. As I have made a means to compile all netbox's data, 
 of which we could then send on to the NMS, which can then be used in DenseWare.
