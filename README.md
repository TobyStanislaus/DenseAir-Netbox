 <h1>Netbox API calls</h1>

 This project fetches the data of the architecture of the DenseAir network from Netbox, 
 which in itself fetches its data from our servers. As I have made a means to compile all the data in our Netbox , 
 of which we could then send on to the NMS, which can then be used in DenseWare.  
     
 In Denseware, this data can give updates to the status and amounts of devices within the DenseAir.
